      "focus_areas": "Pay special attention to vulnerabilities most likely to exist in the language and the type of application.",
      "important_notes": "IMPORTANT:\n- Only report vulnerabilities that are directly evident. Each finding must point to specific lines of code that contain the vulnerability. Do not include general code improvement suggestions or recommendations for validation. Do not speculate about potential issues - only report clear, exploitable vulnerabilities. Focus on technical implementation flaws that could be exploited. For constant value changes or additions, verify exact matches with specifications. Do NOT consider vulnerabilities related to Test cases, documentation, or comments. Do NOT report on general code quality, style, or best practices. Do NOT report on potential future issues or speculative vulnerabilities. Do NOT report on non-security related issues like performance or readability",
      "examples": "Examples of concrete vulnerabilities: \n- Deserializing an elliptic curve point without validating that its coordinates are less than the field modulus.\n- Ignoring error return codes from native cryptographic library functions, leading to the use of unvalidated data.\n- Missing curve or subgroup validation in ECDSA or pairing operations.\n- Integer overflow/underflow in consensus-critical calculations.\n- Unchecked array bounds in RLP decoding.\n- Missing signature malleability checks.\n- Gas costs that deviate from EIP specifications.",

Is this a real security issue or just a deviation from best practices?",
      "be_critical": "BE VERY CRITICAL. Many reported \"vulnerabilities\" are actually:\n- General code quality concerns\n- Theoretical issues with no practical exploit\n- Misunderstandings of the code's purpose\n- Issues in test code or documentation (which don't matter for security)\n- Pre-existing issues not introduced by these changes",
